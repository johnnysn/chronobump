## A simple out-of-the-box metronome web application developed in React
Even though I'm familiar with front-end development using the Angular platform for the past few years, Chrono Bump is the first project I developed in React. 
As a musician and a full-stack developer, I thought it would be fun to learn React by building an application I could use in my guitar practice sessions. 
This project is quite simple and applies most of the core features of React: state management, side effects, custom hooks, routing, etc. 
The only third party library the project depends on is **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)**, to keep it as lean as possible.

## Features
The app allows you to set the tempo, number of beats and the intensity of each beat. It's pretty straightforward to use, trust me :wink:. 

## Run it locally

This project is built with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) ⚡️ and can be easily setup with:

```bash
npm install
```
and executed locally by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Try it out
You can check the application out at **[github.io](https://johnnysn.github.io/chrono-bump)**.
